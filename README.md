# DailyKata
Code solutions to kata's from Code Wars. Most of them will be introductory, very easy to complete and done in Python with the idea that I develop more and more into level 6/5 kyu. 

Eventually I plan on learning and reading more with regards to algorithms and data structures and branching into different languages that I want to grow competence in other than just Python.
